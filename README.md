# Oito Xenon - Faster than the Abacus

Do you miss the good old days when computing was simple, slow, and frustrating? Well, you're in luck, my friend! Oito Xenon is here to take you back to a time when software development was a hobby and CPUs were the size of a house.

This retro-style computer system runs entirely in your browser, using the awesome power of JavaScript. With its 8-bit CPU, Oito Xenon is faster than your grandma's abacus, and can handle a wide range of basic computing tasks. Sure, it may not run Crysis, but who needs fancy modern games when you can spend hours debugging low-level assembly code?

The goal of Oito Xenon is to give you a fun and interactive way to learn about the inner workings of a computer. By building a computer system from scratch, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how modern computing devices work (or, in some cases, don't work).

So, if you're ready to take a trip back in time and experience the joys of retro computing, fire up your browser and dive into Oito Xenon. Just be prepared to lose track of time, and possibly your sanity.

## Specs

- 8MHz OitoArch 8-bit CPU, because who needs modern computing power when you can live in the past?
- 64Kb of RAM, big enough to fit your brain, because let's be honest, you're not that smart.
- CanvasGPU - Display to browser, so you can drown in the semen of your 8-bit graphics.
- No mouse input, but don't worry, if you complain I'll call PETA.
- Cartridge Support? You can finally spend your sanity coding for this system a port of Jedi: Fallen Order.
- 8-bit sound, because 16-bit sound is for wimps.
- 8-bit color, because 16-bit color is for wimps.
- 8-bit everything, because 16-bit everything is for wimps.
- Written in the best langauge in the world: EcmaScript. Yes I'm that good. I don't say Javascript.

## Goal

The goal of Oito Xenon is to take you on a journey back in time to the era of 8-bit computing, where programming was a labor of love and computers were slow enough to give you time to reflect on the meaning of life.

Whether you're a seasoned programmer looking to flex your low-level skills or a curious beginner interested in exploring the foundations of modern computing. I'm not finishing this sentence.

From the bootloader to the kernel to the operating system and programming language, I've traded my sanity and recreated the full stack of an 8-bit computer system in your browser. With Oito Xenon, you'll have a chance to dive into the inner workings of a computer system and see how it all fits together. And who knows, you might even discover a newfound appreciation for modern computing (To be honest, I doubt it).

So strap in and get ready for a journey back in time to a world where computers were slow, programming was hard, and the threat of nuclear was the only thing that kept humanity going.

## Bootloader & Kernel

The Oito Operating Personal System (OOPS) is built upon a sophisticated bootloader and kernel architecture that utilizes advanced techniques to manage system resources efficiently. The bootloader, written in low-level assembly language, employs a multistage bootstrapping process that initializes the hardware components and loads the kernel image into memory. The kernel provides a comprehensive framework for resource management, task scheduling, and memory allocation.

At the heart of the OOPS architecture lies the kernel's Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), a scheduling algorithm that prioritizes tasks based on their relative execution times and resource requirements. The CFS algorithm, based on the concept of virtual runtime, ensures that the system allocates resources fairly among all running tasks, thereby preventing any one task from monopolizing the system's resources.

The kernel also incorporates a sophisticated memory management system, based on the Buddy Allocator algorithm, that efficiently manages the physical memory resources. The Buddy Allocator, a popular algorithm in operating system design, enables the kernel to allocate and deallocate memory blocks of varying sizes with minimal fragmentation and overhead.

I know this flew over your head by the face you're making, but don't worry, I won't explain it to you in a way you can understand.

## Oito Operating Personal System

The Oito Operating Personal System (Oops) is a bare-bones operating system that's perfect for people who can't handle anything more complex than a toaster. I've stripped away all the unnecessary features and programs that you'll never use, leaving you with just the basics. Here's what you can expect from Oops:

- A command-line interface that's so simple even a toddler could use it
- A text editor that's about as advanced as a pencil and paper
- A file management system that's only slightly more advanced than a shoebox
- A Basic interpreter, because ya basic
- A utility for loading and executing programs from cartridges, so you can finally feel like a real programmer
- Games like Gravity Tetrominos, Serpent, Ponger, and Cosmic Invasion (or other non-infringing names). I'm not trying to get sued here, after all.


## OitoLang

OitoLang is the programming language you need for the OitoBit 8-bit virtual CPU. It's simple enough for even a stupid little monkey like you to use. With ownership and borrowing support, OitoLang keeps you from making the usual intern-vibe mistakes that would cause you to shoot yourself in the foot and blow your leg off.

I decided to skip Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) just the thought of adding support for OOP makes me sweat like a nervous freshman on the first day of high school. OOP can be complicated and overwhelming, and frankly, I don't have the time or patience for it. 

I prefer to stick with a functional and procedural programming paradigm that's easy to use and understand. So if you're looking for a programming language that will give you nightmares, look no further than OitoLang is no exception.

Whether you're a seasoned programmer or a clueless beginner, OitoLang is the perfect choice. It's easy to use, efficient, and designed specifically for the OitoBit 8-bit virtual CPU. So why bother with other programming languages that are clearly too advanced for you? Stick with OitoLang and let us do the thinking for you. You'll be glad you did.
